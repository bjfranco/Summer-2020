      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <h2>Object Methods: this</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>https://javascript.info/object-methods</li>
        <li>The value of 'this' is evaluated during run-time, depending on the context.</li>
        <li>When a function is called in the 'method' syntax: object.method(), the value of 'this' during the call is 'object'.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Everything in JS is either one of the 6 primitive data types (strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null) or an object.</li>
          <li>Arrays and functions are both objects.</li>
          <li>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.</li>
          <li>If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method.</li>
          <li>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {}.</li>
          <li>Object literals allow objects to be created quickly without the need for defining a class.</li>
          <li>All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running. This means that its properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const.</li>
          <li>You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation. Ex: superman.name -> 'Superman'</li>
          <li>You can also access an object’s properties using bracket notation. Ex: superman['name'] -> 'Superman'</li>
          <li>Bracket notation also lets you evaluate an expression and use it as the property key: superman["real" + " " + "name"]. This example uses concatenation to output "Clark Kent".</li>
          <li>New properties and methods can be added to objects at any time in a program. This is done by simply assigning a value to the new property. Ex: superman.city = 'Metropolis';</li>
          <li>Any property can be removed from an object using the delete operator. Ex: delete superman.fly;</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Chapter 6: Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.</li>
          <li>The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.</li>
          <li>he DOM treats everything on a web page as a node.</li>
          <li>We can use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web page using a special built-in object called document.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Chapter 7: Events</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions.</li>
          <li>Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.</li>
          
      </ul>
